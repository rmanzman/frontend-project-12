## Chat

### Description:
This is a SPA with registration and authentication that provides any kind of communication and offers a real-time transmission of text messages from sender to receiver. There are permanent (default) channels in the chat, as well as user-created channels. Channels can also be renamed or deleted. Each user action is accompanied by a display of notification, so the interface is as friendly as possible. Chat supports two languages (ru, en) with switching between them at any time. Chat has bad\swear words filtering.
